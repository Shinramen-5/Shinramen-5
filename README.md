## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Krutika Maharana. I recently finished my 12th grade and have started exploring the exciting field of computational biology. I'm really interested in how proteins fold and how their structures can be predicted. Right now, I'm learning to use tools like AlphaFold to better understand how proteins work at the molecular level.

Along with that, Iâ€™m also learning programming so I can apply it to biology and chemistry. I believe combining coding with science opens up a lot of possibilities â€” especially in areas like drug discovery, bioinformatics, and molecular research.

I'm just getting started, but Iâ€™m passionate about learning and growing in this field, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey takes me.
